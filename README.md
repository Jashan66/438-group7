## **Overview**

This Weather App was developed with the intention of using the Weatherstack API to provide users with up-to-date weather information. Although the API integration was not fully functional in the final version, the app’s core structure was built to support the display of weather information based on user input. The design is responsive, offering a consistent experience across different screen sizes and devices. While the feature to save favorite cities was not implemented, the project laid a solid foundation for future work in this area. 

We referred to [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for styling this document.

- **What was your role, and which stories did you work on?**  
  On this project, I worked on the core front-end experience and testing. I created the UI elements for the Home Page and the Favorites screen. Additionally, I developed dynamic components to display weather information and refactored the codebase to be more efficient. Comprehensive tests were written for each component, all of which passed successfully.

- **What was the biggest challenge?**  
  The biggest challenge was navigating Expo's documentation after their upgrade to SDK 51, which introduced breaking changes.

- **Why was it a challenge?**  
  The challenge arose because the upgrade made much of the existing React Native Expo documentation obsolete, requiring careful study of the new SDK 51 and Expo Router documentation.

- **How was the challenge addressed?**  
  I addressed this challenge by thoroughly reading the updated documentation and researching similar public GitHub projects using these technologies for guidance.

- **Favorite/most interesting part of the project?**  
  The most interesting part of the project was implementing dynamic routing through the Expo Router and setting up the app structure to support it.

- **If you could do it over, what would you change?**  
  I would choose a different API, as the free tier of the Weatherstack API limits requests, making it difficult to test the app extensively. I would also invest more time in setting up the core configuration files at the start.

- **What is the most valuable thing you learned?**  
  The most valuable lesson was the importance of examining similar projects early in the development process to better understand how to implement complex features like routing.

## **Conclusion**

- **How successful was the project?**  
  While the project was successful in delivering a well-designed, responsive front-end, several planned features—such as API integration and the favorite cities functionality—were not implemented. The integration challenges impacted the app’s ability to display real-time weather updates. However, the team successfully overcame other technical challenges, like dynamic routing and ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

- **What did you set out to do, and what actually got done?**  
  Although the project did not fully meet the initial goals, it laid a solid foundation for future development. The successful implementation of dynamic components and the app’s responsive design across different devices were significant achievements.

- **What was the largest victory?**  
  The largest victory was ensuring that the app worked seamlessly across both iOS and Android platforms, demonstrating the flexibility and scalability of the front-end design.

- **Final assessment of the project**  
  Overall, the project was a valuable learning experience. Despite not meeting all of the intended functionality, it provided a strong framework for future improvements. With more time, features like API integration and saving favorite cities could be implemented, making the app fully functional as initially envisioned.
